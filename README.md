Datasets on the effects of elevated CO2 on carotenoid levels in plants

Datasets are supporting materials for the following article:
Loladze I, Nolan JM, Ziska LH, Knobbe AR (2019) Rising atmospheric CO2 lowers concentrations of plant carotenoids essential to human health: Meta-analysis, Molecular Nutrition and Food Research (accepted)

One dataset provides the relative changes in carotenoid levels in plants exposed to elevated CO2:
Each raw in the dataset (except the title raw) provides plant species name, common name, plant tissue, the type of experimental facility (e.g. greenhouse, FACE), ambient and elevated CO2 levels, number of observations, relative change in carotenoid levels, the log ratio of the relative change, reference to the original experimental study from which the data were extracted, and notes.


The second dataset provides log2 fold change values in the expression of Arabidopsis thaliana genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis.

For any questions about the dataset, please, email Irakli Loladze at loladze@asu.edu
