# carotenoids
Dataset of the effects of elevated CO2 on carotenoid levels in plants

This dataset is a supporting material for the following article:
Loladze I, Nolan JM, Ziska LH, Knobbe AR (2019) Rising atmospheric CO2 lowers concentrations of plant carotenoids essential to human health: Meta-analysis, Molecular Nutrition and Food Research (accepted)

Each raw in the dataset (except the title raw) provides plant species name, common name, plant tissue, the type of experimental facility (e.g. greenhouse, FACE), ambient and elevated CO2 levels, number of observations, relative change in carotenoid levels, the log ratio of the relative change, reference to the original experimental study from which the data were extracted, and notes.
For any questions about the dataset, please, email Irakli Loladze at loladze@asu.edu
